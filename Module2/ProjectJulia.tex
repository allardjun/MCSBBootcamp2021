\section*{Project 1: Getting to know Matlab}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 


In the coffee.m example, we created an array of values $x(n)$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
x(n+1) = x(n)-\frac{1}{N}\cdot x(n).
\end{equation}

In this project we will study the \footnote{first studied by Gaston Julia, not to be confused with JuliaLang.}{equations}
\begin{align}
x(n+1) &= x(n)^2 - y(n)^2 + c,\\
y(n+1) &= 2x(n) y(n) + d.
\end{align} 

Unless otherwise specified, let $c= -0.8$ and $d =0.156$.


\begin{enumerate}[a.]
%\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Modify (or write your own) code to solve the above equations.
\item For specific starting point \verb|x(1)| and \verb|y(1)| (let's say, \verb|x(1)=0.1, y(1)=0.1|), plot the first 22 values of \verb|x(n)| versus \verb|n|.
\item For specific starting point, plot first 22 values \verb|y(n)| versus \verb|x(n)|.

In the above, the variable \verb|n| was the loop iteration variable (unless you picked another variable name), and this variable went up to \verb|nMax=22|.

\item Write code to create 100 numbers, uniformly randomly selected from the interval (-2,2). Save these in a \verb|1x100| array called \verb|xStart|. Create another 100 uniform random numbers in the interval (-2,2), and store these in an array called \verb|yStart|. Plot all 100 pairs of \verb|xStart| versus \verb|yStart|.  This should be a uniformly random spread of dots in a square. 

\item Now, in a loop, for each of the 100 pairs \verb|xStart,yStart|, compute the equations for 22 steps (so, just like in part b, but now with a different \verb|x(1), y(1)|). For each of these, check if each \verb|x(22),y(22)| is outside the box (-2,2). If so, plot the corresponding \verb|x(1),y(1)| in red. If not, plot it in blue. 

Hint: You will need another loop iteration variable that goes up to 100.

Hint: Since you are plotting the initial values, all values --- both red and blue --- should be in the square (-2,2). 

\item Do the same, but now instead of for 100 pairs, do it for \verb|NStartingPoints=1e5|.  
\item Change parameter value $c$ and $d$ (to whatever you want) and repeat. Hint: very small changes will give best results.
\item Bonus Part: Make a version that records what n each initial x,y leaves the (-2,2) box. Call this \verb|n_at_exit|. Then, when you plot the points that exist, color the points by the value of \verb|n_at_exit|.

Hint: the Matlab function \verb|scatter()| is useful for this.

Suppose a perennial plant has a population $x(n)$ at year $n$, where $x$ is measured in thousands. If the population were growing in an unbounded environment, the population obeys
\begin{equation}
x(n+1) = x(n) + r \cdot x(n)
\end{equation} 
where $r$ is the per-capita growth rate. If instead the population is in a bounded environment, growth is limited, and the population obeys
\begin{equation}
x(n+1) = x(n) + r \left( 1- \frac{x(n)}{K}\right) x(n)
\end{equation} 
where $K$ is a parameter we refer to as the carrying capacity. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $r=0.1$ and $K=0.6$.  Sketch your intuition for the population $x(t)$ from a starting population $x(0)=0.2$. What are the steady states? Which are stable, and which are unstable?
\end{enumerate}

Write Matlab code to solve the dynamical system, and answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Suppose $r=0.1$ and $K=0.6$. Generate time series of the populations for a few starting populations~$x(0)$. Does it match your intuition?
\item Suppose $r=2.1$ and $K=0.6$. Generate time series of the populations for a few starting populations~$x(0)$. 
\end{enumerate}
In a discrete-time dynamical system, if the population cycles between two values, the solution is called a two-cycle. Cycling between $N$ values is called an $N$-cycle. 
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item Check that at $r=2.5$ and $K=0.6$ there is a 4-cycle. Can you find a 3-cycle?
\item In this part, we will do a parameter sweep for $0<r<3.0$, with fixed $K=0.6$. The goal is to generate a diagram where the horizontal axis is the parameter value $r$. On the vertical axis, if there is a stable steady state, plot the steady-state population. If there is an $N$-cycle, plot the $N$ values of $x$ that it cycles through. \footnote{This type of behavior in a dynamical system is called \emph{chaos}! This particular type of chaos is called period-doubling chaos.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hint: One way to plot the steady state or the $N$-cycle is to simulate the system until $n_{\rm max}$, and plot the last half values of $x(n)$. You need to choose $n_{\rm max}$ large enough so that the dynamics have settled into their steady state (or steady cycle) by $n_{\rm max}/2$.
\item Hint: How many $r$ values should you explore? 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In this problem, we ask, if the axon is subject to a force, which mechanical element ``takes a bigger hit"?
